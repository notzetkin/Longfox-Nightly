# Longfox-Nightly: The Night Of The Living Plex
since firefox added window transparency in latest nightly build i had to commemorate

## known bugs:
on windows 10: transparency breaks after minimizing the window maximizing/restoring it fixes this - fixed in the most stupid way (make sure to have firefox theme set to auto)
